WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net color_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin color_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell color_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net eqOp is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin toArduinoNanoData_reg_i_2/O, cell toArduinoNanoData_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (ZPS7-1) PS7 block required - The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
